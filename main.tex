\section{Problem}
\subsection{Formulation}
Streaming video from a drone application, with a varying signal can pose a problem when it comes to efficiency of video quality. How is this handled in a given communication system, with a variable data bit rate?


\subsection{Description}
Analyse how, and when, to handle varying bit rates in a streaming service (in this case, from drone to client), and how one can handle these cases in an optimal way. The analysis will be implemented as a prototype that will show one way to solve this problem.
